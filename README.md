Custom Cherry MX footprints compatable with the native KiCad library.

These footprints allow keyboard designers to abandon the jagged 150-year old

key columns within straight rows of keys.

Subsitute common keycaps sizes as needed. Relabel with replacement keycap stickers. Manufacturers will eventually catch up.

Maple Elite-Pi symbol and footprint. None provided by Keebio in early 2025. Using the Elite-C was unwieldy.
