Files for KiCad PCB design software

Custom Cherry MX footprints compatable with the native KiCad library.

These footprints allow keyboard designers to abandon the jagged 150-year old
mechanical typywriter horizontal keystagger and create uniform angled
key columns within straight rows of keys.

Subsitute common keycaps sizes as needed. Manufacturers will eventually catch up.

Maple Elite-Pi symbol and footprint. I may add a courtyard to the footprint in the future.
