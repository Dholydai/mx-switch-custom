Custom Cherry MX footprints compatible with the native KiCad library and a Maple Elite-Pi symbol and footprint. 

These footprints allow keyboard designers to abandon the jagged 150-year old mechanical typewriter horizontal keystagger and 
create uniform linear angled key columns within straight rows of keys.

Quality of key switches:

1. I built two full-sized keyboards with Gateron switches... never again! They are deformed; key caps are jacked around at all angles. 
2. Cherry MX switches have great quality. Never had a problem with them. Going forward, I build all of my keyboards with Cherry switches.

Availability of keycap sets:

I have been subsituting common keycaps sizes for the exotic sizes required. I buy large XDA keycap sets, and relabel selected keycaps with keyboard 
stickers as needed.

In May 2025 that all changed. There is now a keycap manufacturer that makes one-off custom sets. The Maxmus shown above is populated by the first set 
that I created.

YUZU custom keycaps will make any die-sub keycap set that your heart desires. Common sizes still have to be sustituted. Being able to choose keycap 
sizes, colors, and legends is game changing. I have designed and bought five sets in two months. Good quality product.
