Custom Cherry MX footprints compatable with the native KiCad library.

These footprints allow keyboard designers to abandon the 150-year old
mechanical typywriter horizontal keystagger and create uniform angled
key columns within straight rows of keys.

Subsitute common keycaps sizes as needed. Manufacturers will catch up.

Maple Elite-Pi symbol and footprint. It was confusing to use the Elite-C.
Perhaps I may add a courtyard.
