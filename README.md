Files for KiCad PCB design software.

Custom Cherry MX footprints compatible with the native KiCad library and a Maple Elite-Pi symbol and footprint. 

These footprints allow keyboard designers to abandon the jagged 150-year old mechanical typewriter horizontal keystagger and 
create uniform linear angled key columns within straight rows of keys.

I have been subsituting common keycaps sizes from large XDA keycapy sets, and relabeling them with keycap stickers as neeeded.

YUZU custom keycaps makes any die-sub keycap set that your heart desires. I have designed and bought five sets in two months. Even
with the new high tariffs, the price is a affordable. Good quality product.
